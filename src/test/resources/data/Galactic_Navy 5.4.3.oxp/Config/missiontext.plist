	<string>Sorry Commander\n\nYou're too green.  I am amazed you managed to dock your ship without crashing.  The Thargoids would eat you alive... if you could even find them.\n\nCome back when you've gained some combat experience.</string>

	<key>seccom_mostlyharmless</key>
	<string>Sorry Commander\n\nYou're too green.  Reserve pilots face serious combat, and it'd be like sending a Tiinlebian tree lamb to the slaughter.\n\nCome back when you've gained some more combat experience.</string>

	<key>seccom_poor</key>
	<string>Sorry Commander\n\nYou're still too green.  Sure, you've made a few kills, but you're still not ready to take on the Thargoid Hordes.  You wouldn't last five minutes against the bugs.\n\nCome back when you've gained some more combat experience.</string>

	<key>seccom_average</key>
	<string>Sorry Commander\n\nYou're not ready.  Reserve pilots need more than a few dozen kills under their belt before they're ready to take on the Thargoids.  You'd be lucky to survive the first encounter.\n\nCome back when you've gained some more combat experience.</string>

	<key>seccom_aboveaverage</key>
	<string>Sorry Commander\n\nYou're not quite ready.  The Navy won't accept anything less than Competent pilots for reserve duty.  You need a few more kills before taking on the Thargoids.\n\nCome back when you've gained a little more combat experience.</string>

	<key>seccom_reserve_enlist</key>
	<string>Hello Commander\n\nI am [mid-navyrank] [nom].  I oversee reserve recruitment for this Sector.  Are you interested in serving the Navy as a reserve pilot?\n\nAll graduates of the Lave Academy with a Competent rating are eligible for duty.  Once enlisted, reserve pilots check in with the local Reserve Squadron Commander at any SecCom to receive their assignments.  Service is completely voluntary and no salary is paid.  Unlike regular Navy, however, Reserve pilots may keep all bounties collected during their missions and earn bonuses based on sorties flown.\n\nWould you like to enlist?</string>

	<key>seccom_reserve_pass</key>
	<string>That's unfortunate.  Stop back if you change your mind.\n\nAnything else?</string>

	<key>seccom_reserve_intro</key>
	<string>Excellent!\n\nWelcome to the Navy Reserves!  I will enter your information into the reserve registry immediately Commander [commander_name].  It is vital that we have accurate records to contact your next of kin.  Seventy percent of rookie pilots don't survive their first mission.  Good Luck!\n\nThe Reserve Squadron Commander's office is just down the hall if you would like to get started immediately.</string>

You are to make your way to [mission_reserve_planetname], form up with the reserve squadron, and destroy the pirates along with their base.

	<string>\n--- After docking, you are approached by a high ranking Galactic Navy Officer.  He asks if you would be interested in performing a dangerous covert mission in exchange for large number of credits.</string>

	<key>hofd_decline</key>
	<string>\nSo be it.\n\nSee you around Commander.</string>

	<key>hofd_intro</key>
	<string>---This information is highly sensitive commander.  You may not divulge it to anyone under pain of death.\n\nI am sure you are familiar with legendary Navy Admiral Kurtz the decorated and undefeated hero of the Thargoid Wars. From his flagship, the behemoth carrier Nellie, Admiral Kurtz  commands a large carrier group of more than a dozen warships.  Concern has been growing as we have been unable to contact the Admiral or his fleet for some time.\n The Navy regards Admiral Kurtz as one of its most capable officers.  He is a brilliant military tactician and an unrivaled leader of men.  Recent reports indicate, however, that Kurtz's genius may have spiraled into megalomania.  It appears he has gone quite mad and is now operating completely outside of Navy Command.   We would like you to locate, capture, and return him to the nearest SecCom Station for evaluation and treatment.\nIt is vitally important that Admiral Kurtz is not killed.  An assassination could spurn officers loyal to Kurtz into revolt and spark a deadly civil war.  Find Admiral Kurtz, return him to a SecCom Station, and the Navy will reward you with 25,000 credits.\nThe Nellie was last reported in orbit around the planet Ririso. Take this 1500 credits for out-fitting and expenses. Good Luck.

	<key>hofd_kurtz_offer</key>
	<string>---After docking you are quickly surrounded by a sqaud of marines and escorted to the bridge---\n\nWelcome Commander,\n\nMy name is Admiral J Kurtz, and I have been expecting you.  Navy Command has sent you here to capture me.  They have told you I am mad and that I need help.  Well, I am not mad Commander, and I will not be captured.  The Navy has deceived you! The corrupt command structure is threatened by my popularity with the common officer and fears I will usurp their power.  They wish to eliminate me!\n\nWhy are you wasting your talents serving such incompetents?  A pilot of your skill and experience deserves better.  Join my forces Commander, and I promise you service more commensurate with your capabilities.</string>

	<key>hofd_service</key>
	<string>You join Admiral Kurtz as a dedicated Lieutenant.\n\nAs time passes you begin to feel that perhaps the Navy was right.  Kurtz becomes increasing cruel and his rule more absolute.  You watch as the Admiral carries out atrocities against local populations.  When one outspoken officer dares to question the Admiral's methods Kurtz has him summarily executed and his severed head placed on a pike decorating the bridge.\n\nYou decide discretion is the better part of valor and attempt to desert the Admiral's command.  Safely making your way into the hanger, you begin prepping your ship for launch when a sentry sounds the alarm!  Your desertion will not be taken lightly.</string>

	<key>hofd_no_service</key>
	<string>You fool!\n\nI do not need help.  Not from you or anyone else. I misjudged you Commander. You are nothing but a weak minded pawn of Navy Command.  I suggest you be on your way while I still allow it.  I have little patience for incompetence.</string>

	<key>hofd_welldone</key>
	<string>Well Done Commander!\n\nThe Navy thanks you for your service.  Admiral Kurtz will get the best possible treatment and care.  Here is your 25,000 Credits as promised.</string>

No offical cause of death has been given, but the Press Secrectary is on record saying,  "that it was in no way unusual or suspicious."\n\nAdmiral Kurtz was the Navy's most decorated officer and had never lost a single engagement with the thargoid menace.

Galcop has vehemently denied the charges and promised a full investigation.\n\nThe Navy Press Secretary has issued an official statement praising Admiral Kurtz for his many years of  dedicated service.\n\n"Admiral Kurtz was an unparalleled leader of men and a brilliant military tactician.  A true hero of our time, his loss will be felt throughout the galaxy.  Navy Intelligence has already begun a search for the cowardly assassin and will not rest until he is brought to justice."\n\nMemorial services are being planned at the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard.

Galcop has vehemently denied the charges and promised a full investigation.\n\nSince the attack Admiral Kurtz has gone into hiding along  with a large contingent of loyal officers.
