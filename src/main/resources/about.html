            <p>Welcome to Oolite Starter. This is an addon project to the legendary
                <a href="https://oolite.space">Oolite</a>. It evolved from a 
                <a href="http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?p=289311#p289311">discussion
                on the forum</a>.

                Mr Gimlet - Dockmaster at Lave Coriolis 1 - may be quirky
                but it is worthwhile listening to him. After him there is no one
                else to listen to anyway.
